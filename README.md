# Snowfall Map

### _GIS4533 Final Project Example_

## First Draft

#### Statement of Purpose
This web map is intended to be utilized by anyone in the general public who is interested in finding out information regarding recent snowfall events. The goal of this web map is to present in a visually appealing and coherently informative manner recent snowfall totals from across the United States. The main focus of the website will be a web map that will allow users to view recent snowfall totals as individual events or as a continuous statistical surface (ie. heatmap). The website will be appropriately themed and visually appealing as well as accessible to users of all skills.

## Second Draft

#### Functioning web app
https://kristofj-umd.github.io/let-it-snow/

#### Work plan
1. Snowfall data  
  a. Load snowfall data into app  
  b. Add, symbolize, and render snowfall data  
2. Finish side panel  
  a. Add content  
  b. style side panel  
2. Functionality  
  a. add popups  
  b. add filtering  
3. If I have time :clock  
  a. add heatmap layer  
  b. zoom-based symbology  
4. Clean up if I have time  

#### List of three issues
1. I'm not sure if I like my mapbox basemap. Should I make it lighter? Darker? Switch to something else entirely?
2. Should I include snowfall data as a popup, a tooltip, on the side panel?
3. Are there additional layers or functionality I should include?
